\brief Spatialtemporal scoring in IMP

This flexible code is for analyzing stepwise spatiotemporal models, such as those we used to compute our model of NPC assembly. If you are interested in using this code, please check out our examples. Our code is modular and easy to modify, as described in the spatiotemporal folder.
