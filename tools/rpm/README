This directory contains files to build RPM packages for RedHat Linux and
similar systems (we have tested it on current versions of RHEL and Fedora,
but it may work on other RPM-based Linux variants).

To use, simply copy IMP.spec.in to IMP.spec and replace @IMP_VERSION@ with
your IMP version number.
